# workshop-buzz-finder
Fall 2017 beginner project for agency

This is the first of the Agency beginner projects, targeted at people who are just starting out with AI. 

## Premise

You will be writing code to help [buzzmobile](https://github.com/gtagency/buzzmobile), our autonomous car, navigate Tech's campus to find Buzz.
This takes place in our state-of-the-art simulator. Later on, we will add to the game and talk about better algorithms
for solving these problems. For now, we'll just use a simple breadth first search to find the shortest path to Buzz. 

## Running

The only dependencies are `python 3.x` and a web browser. 

After cloning, run `python server.py` from the repo root.
Now, go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ or http://localhost:8000/ (if one doesn't work try the other).
You should see a maze, and the buzzmobile icon will move one square in the grid. If anything seems broken, just refresh the page.
